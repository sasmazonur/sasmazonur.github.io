                              <p>The FollowBot has been designed with the Intel RealSense Depth Camera D415 series that uses stereo vision to calculate the distance between robot and human. The human following method has the ability to differentiate a person and other objects. As well as follow a person in real-time using deep neural networks. The human following robot also has the ability to create 2D and 3D maps of its environment using simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The 2D occupancy grid map is created from the laser scan data, and the mobile robot pose. And 3D map created by using the RGB-D Graph SLAM approach called Real-Time Appearance Based Mapping (RTAB-Map). </p>
                              <p>The robot was implemented in Python, C++, C, C#, and has been tested in real-life testing scenarios.</p>

                                <p>Wasteagram is a mobile app that enables restaurants/coffees employees to document daily food waste in the form of "posts" consisting of a photo, number of leftover items, the current date, and the location of the device when the post is created.</p>
                                <ul>
                                <li>Application stores photos in Cloud Storage, and generates a unique name for each photo stored.</li>
                                <li>Application stores food waste post as a Firestore document with a date, image url, item count and latitude/longitude.</li>
                                <li>Unit tests test the model, and integration tests verify any one particular part of the UX flow.</li>
                                <li>Displays a list of food waste posts, presenting the date and number of items in each entry.</li>
                                <li>App bar displays total number of wasted items.</li>
                                <li>Application displays the details of a food waste post when tapped on in the list.</li>

                             <p>The goal of this project was to learn concepts and techniques for developing and deploying RESTful APIs on the cloud.</p>
                             <p>The application implemented with REST API that uses proper resource based URLs, pagination and status codes. The application deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Datastore to store the data. Requests for the REST API resources uses a JWT (Auth0) for authentication.</p>
